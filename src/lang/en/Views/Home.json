The platform will allow doctors to easily switch between hospitals and be assigned to duty, and patients to find a doctor in their area. The startup will work with local hospitals to ensure each ward is staffed with a doctor of the appropriate specialty. Click on the picture to see the video presentation.",

      "title": "The Challenge of Recruiting Medical Staff",
      "text": "Hospitals often face difficulties in staffing night shifts due to the limited availability of specialized medical professionals. The lack of employees can cause significant disruptions in hospital operations. Recruiting through conventional job portals is not convenient and effective, as they require detailed job descriptions and a lengthy recruitment process. Maintaining a large pool of shift job offers and reviewing multiple candidates for night shifts can be overwhelming and time-consuming for the recruitment units, especially in emergency situations where a replacement is needed quickly. The solution to this problem is the development of a platform that facilitates the rapid and efficient recruitment of medical professionals for night shifts.

      "title": "Our Prototype System",
      "text": "The prototype system streamlines the medical staff recruitment process with its calendar feature that displays all scheduled shifts and makes it easy to post a new shift. The shift posting is then shared with other hospitals, allowing them to fill the open shift efficiently. The application acceptance process is also simplified, with the ability to view candidate profiles and make informed decisions on whether to accept or reject their application. This system ensures that the medical department is fully staffed and prepared to provide the best care to patients. Click on the picture to see the video presentation.",

      "quote": "We define value improvement as better patient outcomes relative to the costs of achieving them. With this central goal, healthcare enterprises need to measure and be far more accountable for patient outcomes [...]. The single most powerful step to improve health outcomes is to just start measuring them at the level of patients with a given medical ­condition—such as breast cancer or knee or hip arthritis—or in delivering primary and preventative care for patient segments such as healthy adults. The act of measurement will improve outcomes better and faster than any single new surgical technique, medical device, or drug."

      "quote": "The only way to achieve sustainable cost reduction is to understand the structure of delivery itself, which requires looking at how an organization is currently spending money to treat patients for specific medical conditions. This allows identifying the inefficient and ineffective processes (those not contributing to better outcomes), understanding whether the right type of employee is performing each process step, and so on. With this information, providers can make fundamental process improvements that enable them to accomplish the same amount of work or better, with fewer or less expensive resources and without harming outcomes. That is where sustainable cost reductions must come from."

Measuring and reporting risk-adjusted outcomes by provider for each of these medical conditions will trigger enormous improvements in the treatments of patients."
